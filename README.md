# Sitecore Docker Examples

This repository contains companion code for the [Sitecore Containers documentation](https://containers.doc.sitecore.com/). Together, these are meant to help you get started using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers with Sitecore.

Briefly, here's what you'll find in this repo:

* Example for running an out of the box Sitecore instance (see `getting-started`).
* Example solution for creating custom Sitecore images, with recommended folder structure for container development (see `custom-images`).
* Sample PowerShell scripts for container-based Sitecore instance preparation (`init.ps1`) and cleanup (`clean.ps1`).
* Docker compose files for building Sitecore instances in various topologies (see `custom-images`).

Please refer to the [Sitecore Containers documentation](https://containers.doc.sitecore.com/) for complete details, including running the examples and recommended usage.
